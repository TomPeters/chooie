Chui (pronounced "chewy") is a web interface for Package Managers. It was originally envisioned as a package manager for Chocolatey, but it is now planned that it could support any package manager through a plugin system.

It is designed to be a simple to use system that sits in your system tray. Double clicking it will open the web interface which will allow you to interact with your package manager of choice. Supported actions will initially include: Installing a package manager, installing a package and removing a package.
